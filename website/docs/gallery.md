Below are example renders produced with `astonish.py`. Thumbnails link to the full-resolution images in the `outputs/` folder.

<div style="display:flex;gap:24px;flex-wrap:wrap;">

[![1080p thumbnail](../static/img/astonish_1920x1080_thumb.png)](/outputs/astonish_1920x1080.png)

[![4K thumbnail](../static/img/astonish_3840x2160_thumb.png)](/outputs/astonish_3840x2160.png)

</div>

To view the images locally, open the files in `outputs/`.

If you rebuild the images yourself, place them in `outputs/` and they will be available from the site when served.
