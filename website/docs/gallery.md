Below are example renders produced with `astonish.py`. The images were generated and saved into the repository `outputs/` folder.

Files generated in this session:

- `outputs/astonish_1920x1080.png` — a 1080p flow-field render.
- `outputs/astonish_3840x2160.png` — a 4K flow-field render.

To view the images locally, open the files in `outputs/`.

If you rebuild the images yourself, place them in `outputs/` and they will appear here when the site is served.
