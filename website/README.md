# Astonish docs (Docusaurus)

This folder contains a minimal Docusaurus site that documents the `astonish.py` generative art script.

To run locally (if you have Node.js and Docusaurus installed):

```
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

Note: this is a light scaffold; the actual renders live in the repo `outputs/` folder.
